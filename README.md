🚀 Exciting New Android App for Kids – Empowering the Next Generation with Legal Knowledge! 🚀

I'm thrilled to showcase my latest Android application, built using Android Studio with Java and MySQL for the database! 🎉 This app is designed to educate kids about their legal rights in a fun, engaging, and interactive way.

The app features three exciting modules:

🎥 Animated Stories – Fun, colorful animations to teach kids important legal concepts.
🎮 AI-powered Game – An interactive, situation-based game that adapts based on the choices kids make, helping them understand real-life scenarios and legal decisions.
📝 Quiz Section – A fun quiz to test their knowledge on legal rights in a playful way.
And to keep things light-hearted, we've added a jokes section to bring a smile to their faces! 😄

The goal is to make learning about legal rights enjoyable and accessible to younger audiences. I’m excited to see how this app can make a difference in educating the next generation. 💡
